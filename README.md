# Vuk

Vuk is an IDL parser and visualizer.

It supports the following IDLs:
- AIDL
- gRPC / Protobuf
- Rest/JSON

It starts by selecting an item (e.g. interface or structure) and may display dependant and depending items as a tree. As the tree can be large or even infinite, the elements are always collapsed and must be manually expanded.
